# Insomnium

Insomnium is a 100% local and privacy-focus open-source API client for testing GraphQL, REST, WebSockets, Server-sent events and gRPC in development/production.

https://github.com/ArchGPT/insomnium

- âœ… works 100% offline, the way a local testing tool should behave <br>
- âœ… no cloud services, no tracking/communication to external servers behind the scene <br>
- âœ… runs much faster and smoother than Insomnia <br>
- ðŸ¦™ (coming up) optional integration to local LLMs like CodeLlama for front-end code generation in React, Vue, htmx, etc, based on the API response JSON
