<b>There are two ways to migrate data from Insomnia to Insomnium.</b>

1. In Insomnia, use the GUI button <kbd >Export files from the "Insomnia" Project</kbd>  under `Perference/Data` to export files (e.g. to your `~/Downloads`). <br/><br/>After that, open Insomnium and import these files using the <kbd >Import to the "Insomnium" Project</kbd> button under its `Perference/Data`.
